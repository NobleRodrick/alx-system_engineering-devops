Issue Summary:

- Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on April 10, 2024 (UTC).
- Impact: The service outage affected the web application's login functionality, rendering it inaccessible to users. Approximately 30% of users were unable to log in during the outage period.
- Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the authentication service, leading to failed authentication attempts and denial of service.

Timeline:

- 10:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed login attempts.
- 10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
- 10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on server logs to identify potential issues with the authentication service.
- 10:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue was due to a database connection error.
- 10:45 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
- 11:00 AM: Root cause identified as misconfiguration in authentication service settings.
- 11:30 AM: Configuration corrected, and service restored to normal functionality.
- 12:00 PM: Issue resolved, and monitoring confirms normal login activity.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced to an incorrect configuration setting in the authentication service, causing it to reject valid login attempts. Specifically, a recent update to the authentication service inadvertently changed the default settings, leading to denial of service for user authentication requests.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team rolled back the recent configuration update and restored the authentication service settings to their previous state. Additionally, thorough testing was conducted to ensure that the login functionality was fully restored before declaring the issue resolved.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes: 
  - Implement stricter change management procedures to prevent unintended configuration changes.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect misconfigurations and service failures more quickly.

- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Implement automated configuration validation checks to ensure consistency across services.
  2. Conduct regular audits of service configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
  3. Enhance documentation and training for engineering teams on best practices for configuration management.
  4. Develop and implement a rollback plan for rapid response to similar incidents in the future.
  
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages occurring in the future and improve the overall reliability and resilience of our systems.
